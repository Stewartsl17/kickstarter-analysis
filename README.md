# kickstarter-analysis
## Project Overview
In this project, we were tasked with analyzing a dataset of Kickstarter campaigns for various theater plays in order to recommend the optimal launch period for future campaigns. Within this, we looked at a variety of factors including the costs associated with successful and failed campaigns, the best time of year to launch a campaign, and the types of theater campaigns that garnered the most attention via Kickstarter.  
## Conclusions
*From the data based on the outcomes of the parent categories, we can see that theater has the highest number of successful campaigns among the catagories specified.

*Based on the data analysis of outcomes by years, we can see that within the theater category, 2015 shows the point of highest amount of successful campaigns.

*Furthermore, based on the data analysis of the outcomes, we can observe that May is the optimal point of launching a successful campaign. December, on the other hand, is a problematic time to start a campaign.
