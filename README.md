# kickstarter-analysis
## Project Overview
In this project, we were tasked with analyzing a dataset of Kickstarter campaigns for various theater plays in order to recommend the optimal launch period for future campaigns. Within this, we looked at a variety of factors including the costs associated with successful and failed campaigns, the best time of year to launch a campaign, and the types of theater campaigns that garnered the most attention via Kickstarter.
