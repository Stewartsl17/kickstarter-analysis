# kickstarter-analysis
## Project Overview
In this project, we were tasked with analyzing a dataset of Kickstarter campaigns for various theater plays in order to recommend the optimal launch period for future campaigns. Within this, we looked at a variety of factors including the costs associated with successful and failed campaigns, the best time of year to launch a campaign, and the types of theater campaigns that garnered the most attention via Kickstarter.  
## Conclusions
From the data based on the outcomes of the parent categories, we can see that theater has the highest number of successful campaigns among the catagories specified.
